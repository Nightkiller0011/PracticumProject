    <li>1 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “I am grateful for [my family’s] enthusiastic support of this decision and for good friends who helped me decide to serve..”</li>
    <li>2 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “Looking back, I can see even more clearly that they trusted me and loved me. They taught me the gospel. They expected a lot from me..”</li>
    <li>3 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “Fathers and mothers of these wonderful youth, you have a vital role in this preparation process. Begin today to talk with your children about missionary service."</li>
    <li>4 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “And please consider this: whether or not we know them, we are each born of a mother and father. And each mother and father is born of a mother and father.5 By birth or adoptive lineage, we are ultimately all connected in the family of God and in the human family.” </li>
    <li>5 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “Whether you are your first or tenth known generation, connect yesterday for tomorrow. Connect the roots and branches in your living family tree.”</li>
    <li>6 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “When asked where meaning comes in life, most people rank family first. This includes family living and gone before. Of course, when we die, we don’t cease to exist. We continue to live on the other side of the veil.”</li>
    <li>7 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “Sometimes unwavering commitment to abiding family relationships helps us accomplish hard things. In some cases, community becomes family.”</li>
    <li>8 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Family Councils, "Family councils have always been needed. They are, in fact, eternal. We belonged to a family council in the premortal existence, when we lived with our heavenly parents as their spirit children."</li>
    <li>9 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Family Councils, "Family councils, on the other hand, can be held on any day of the week, and they are primarily a meeting at which parents listen—to each other and to their children."</li>
    <li>10 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Family Councils, "First, the full family council includes all family members."</li>
    <li>Position Statement- I believe that family is one of the most important things that we have on this earth. Family are here to love and appreciate us and to show us right from wrong. If we are able to keep focused and learn, we can spread the spirit to our families and also feel the spirit from them. Loving all those around us is important and loving our family is one of the most important and key things here on our life on earth.</li>

<ul name="AgencyList">
    <li>1 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “For you young and able sisters, a mission is also a powerful, but optional, opportunity. We love sister missionaries and welcome them wholeheartedly. What.”</li>
    <li>2 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “In those days, going on a mission was in the back of my mind, but it wasn’t something I talked about with my parents.”</li>
    <li>3 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “Although we did not attend church services as a family, that did not prevent me from attending occasionally with my friends..”</li>
    <li>4 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “To the missionaries currently serving, we thank you. Your mission has been during a worldwide pandemic. As a result, your mission experience has been unlike my mission experience or the experiences of any missionaries who served before 2020. I know it has not been easy. But even during these difficult times, the Lord has had a work for you to do, and you have done it wonderfully well.”</li>
    <li>5 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “He made clear that we are free to choose between right and wrong and that we cannot avoid the consequences of our choices.” </li>
    <li>6 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “If you look back on your life, I believe you will see that you have exercised faith many times. Joining the Church is an act of faith.”</li>
    <li>7 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, The Lord also operates through conditions: conditions of faith, conditions of righteousness, conditions of repentance.” </li>
    <li>8 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “Even God’s love, although infinite and perfect, is also subject to conditions.” </li>
    <li>9 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “First, we must humble ourselves. The Lord’s condition for change is humility. ‘If they humble themselves before me,’ He said. The opposite of humility is pride. Pride exists when we think we know better—when what we think or feel takes priority over what God thinks or feels.”</li>
    <li>10 Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “I realized that every decision I would make for the rest of my life would be influenced by these truths.”</li>
    <li>Position Statement- I feel like in terms of where my position is on Agency, I love that we are here to learn about agency. If we ponder our pre-mortal life, then we can realize that in that time, we learned what right and wrong are, but learning and experiencing are very different. We must experience right and wrong to be able to fully understand it. Wemust be here and make choices on our own to be able to return to Heavenly father as fully spiritual beings.</li>

<h1 name="Atonement" class="Atonement">Atonement</h1>
<ul name="AtonementList">
    <li>1 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “I love the Lord Jesus Christ and testify that His gospel is the only enduring solution for peace. His gospel is a gospel of peace.”</li>
    <li>2 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “The spiritual darkness in the world makes the light of Jesus Christ needed more than ever.” </li>
    <li>3 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “President Kimball explained his vision for how the gospel would be taken to all the world. He called for many more missionaries from around the world.” </li>
    <li>4 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “He reminded us of the Lord’s expectation “that every man should … lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the earth.” </li>
    <li>5 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “Anyone with eyes to see the signs of the times and ears to hear the words of prophets knows that is true. The perils of greatest danger come to us from the forces of wickedness. Those forces are increasing. And so it will become more difficult, not easier, to honor the covenants we must make and keep to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.” </li>
    <li>6 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “All of us face boisterous winds that can shake our faith and cause us to sink. When this happens, please remember that Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness has another name—the plan of redemption.” </li>
    <li>7 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “Heavenly Father knew that we would need to be redeemed. This is why He prepared the plan of redemption.”</li>
    <li>8 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “Coming unto Christ means more than just thinking about Him or talking about Him or even loving Him. It means following Him. It means living the way He teaches us to live.”</li>
    <li>9 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “I testify that the plan of happiness works. It was created by your Heavenly Father, who loves you. It works because Jesus Christ overcame sin and death through His Atonement.”</li>
    <li>10  Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven.”</li>
    <li>Position Statement- The atonement is very important in the current age because we need to remember WHY it happened. If we are unable to remember why the atonement happened, then we will not be able to fully appreciate it. Jesus died so that we, as imperfect beings, could be forgiven and return to heavenly father once again. He loved us so much that he sacrificed a perfect body so that we could be perfect again like he was.</li>

<h1 name="Addiction" class="Addiction">Addiction</h1>
<ul name="AddictionList">
    <li>1 Russell M Nelson- October 1988 General Conference, "Yet many of our good friends who use tobacco may not believe it to be addicting. Some are reluctant to admit that their behavior is substantially controlled by a drug. We understand those feelings."</li>
    <li>2 Russell M Nelson- October 1988 General Conference, "We reach out in love to family, friends, and neighbors, regardless of nationality or creed, who suffer addiction. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to help relieve this international plague."</li>
    <li>3 Russell M Nelson- October 1988 General Conference, "The solution to this problem ultimately is neither governmental nor institutional. Nor is it a question of legality. It is a matter of individual choice and commitment. Agency must be understood. The importance of the will in making crucial choices must be known. Then steps toward relief can follow."</li>
    <li>4 Russell M Nelson- October 1988 General Conference, "Choose to Be Alive. Seek beloved family, friends, and physicians. Plead for their help. Your precious life is at stake. Cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves—to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life."</li>
    <li>5 Dieter F Uchtdorf- Are You Sleeping Through the Restoration?, "Addictions often begin subtly. Addictions are thin threads of repeated action that weave themselves into thick bonds of habit."</li>
    <li>6 Dieter F Uchtdorf- Are You Sleeping Through the Restoration?, "These binding chains of addiction can have many forms, like pornography, alcohol, sex, drugs, tobacco, gambling, food, work, the Internet, or virtual reality."</li>
    <li>7 Dieter F Uchtdorf- Are You Sleeping Through the Restoration?, "The first thing we must understand is that addictions are so much easier to prevent than to cure. In the Savior’s words, “Suffer none of these things to enter into your heart.”"</li>
    <li>8 Dieter F Uchtdorf- Are You Sleeping Through the Restoration?, "The best defense against addiction is never to start."</li>
    <li>9 Linda S Reeves- Protection From Pornography- A Christ Focused Home, "We as leaders are also greatly concerned about the spouses and families of those suffering from pornography addiction. Elder Richard G. Scott has pleaded: “If you are free of serious sin yourself, don’t suffer needlessly the consequences of another’s sins. … You can feel compassion. … Yet you should not take upon yourself a feeling of responsibility for those acts.”"</li>
    <li>10 Linda S Reeves- Protection From Pornography- A Christ Focused Home, "Brothers and sisters, how do we protect our children and youth? Filters are useful tools, but the greatest filter in the world, the only one that will ultimately work, is the personal internal filter that comes from a deep and abiding testimony of our Heavenly Father’s love and our Savior’s atoning sacrifice for each one of us."</li>
    <li>Position Statement- I know how difficult Addiction can be. I have suffered from a few addictions, though none of which ever harmed myself. I have been addicted to Pornography and gaming online, and I found that it all stemmed from high stress and needing a way to relieve that. I found later on, that if I am able to be honest and ask for help, then I can find other ways to relieve my stress. Asking for help is one of the best ways to help an addiction. Setting up blocks can help you so that you do not fall into those hardships and challenges.</li>

<ul name="ForgivenessList">
    <li>1  Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “As followers of Jesus Christ, we plead with leaders of nations to find peaceful resolutions to their differences.” </li>
    <li>2 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.”</li>
    <li>3 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “No matter where we are and where we have been, repentance is the way forward.”     </li>
    <li>4 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, ““Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance.” </li>
    <li>5 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “Third, through His grace He can make weak things become strong. If we humble ourselves and have faith in Jesus Christ, then His grace will enable us to change. In other words, He will empower us to change.” </li>
    <li>6 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “One of Satan’s greatest lies is that men and women cannot change. This untruth gets told and retold in many different ways as the world says that we simply cannot change” </li>
    <li>7 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “If our goal is to be authentic to this divine nature and destiny, then we will all need to change. The scriptural word for change is repentance.” </li>
    <li>8  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “In our day, many have adopted the concept that there should be no consequence for sin. They support the unconditional condoning of sin without repentance.”</li>
    <li>9  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “personal repentance is a commanded prerequisite to partake of the Savior’s Atonement and inherit the celestial kingdom.”</li>
    <li>10  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “We understand the overwhelming significance of the Savior’s Atonement and of His saving ordinances and covenants, including those performed in the temple.” </li>
    <li>Position Statement- My position on Forgiveness is that it is incredibly important. I believe that if we are able to forgive others, then we will be blessed, because much like when we ask for forgiveness from heavenly father, we are able to be fully forgiven, and he will no longer remember our transgressions. Forgiveness is something that we can use to bring anyone to the gospel.</li>

    <li>3 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, … whereon if men build they cannot fall.”</li>
    <li>4 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “Peter had shown faith, both in walking on the water and in reaching out to the Savior when he needed help. Even so, the Savior saw in Peter the potential for so much more.” </li>
    <li>5 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “Come unto Him, follow Him, and ‘immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.’” </li>
    <li>6 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “He first says that He gives men and women weakness, singular, which is part of our mortal experience as fallen or carnal beings.” </li>
    <li>7 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “He then says that His grace is sufficient and that if we will humble ourselves and have faith in Him, then He will ‘make weak things [plural] become strong unto [us].’” </li>
    <li>8 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “He will give us the power to overcome our weaknesses. Humility, coupled with faith in Jesus Christ, will allow us to access the enabling power of His grace and the fulness of blessings available because of His Atonement.”</li>
    <li>9  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “It was clear that Joe could do more good taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world than becoming a doctor at an earlier date.”</li>
    <li>10  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “Over a lifetime of service and spiritual experiences, I have come to understand that true conversion is the result of the conscious acceptance of the will of God and that we can be guided in our actions by the Holy Ghost.” </li>
    <li>Position Statement- My position on Patience is definately getting better. I have always been a bit impatient. This is because I have always had ADHD and it can be pretty difficult to focus. Being able to practice patience allows me to keep track of where my mind is so that I can study easier and work harder.</li>

    <li>2  M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “He will give you experiences with promptings from the Holy Ghost. The Lord will authorize you to teach in His name.” </li>
    <li>3  M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “It has been almost 10 years since President Thomas S. Monson announced the lowering of the missionary age for young men and young women. In my view, a primary reason for this change was to give more of our youth the life-changing opportunity to serve as a missionary.” </li>
    <li>4 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “The growing storms are the temptations and the increasing attacks of Satan. It has never been more important than it is now to understand how to build on that sure foundation.” </li>
    <li>5 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “We want with all our hearts not to shrink but rather to look up at Him, see Him smile, and hear Him say, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: … enter [in].”” </li>
    <li>6 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, As you perform temple ordinances for family members, the spirit of Elijah, “a manifestation of the Holy Ghost bearing witness of the divine nature of the family,” </li>
    <li>7 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “I am in awe of Peter’s faith. At Jesus’s simple invitation to “come,” he left his storm-tossed ship. He seemed to know that if Jesus Christ invited him to do something, he could do it.” </li>
    <li>8 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “My daughter prayed to know what she should do to help this missionary. The impression she received was that the scriptures were not given only so we can read them and obtain a testimony; they were given also to teach us to keep the commandments of God.”</li>

    <li>Position Statement- My position on spiritual strength is that It can always be improved. We can always learn more ablout the gospel and we can always become closer to heavely father. The gospel is always growing and our testimonies should follow in that growth.</li>

    <li>2  Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “You young men have been reserved for this time when the promised gathering of Israel is taking place. As you serve missions, you play a pivotal role in this unprecedented event!.” </li>

    <li>6 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “Of all the training I have received in my Church assignments, none has been more important to me than the training I received as a nineteen-year-old elder serving a full-time mission.” </li>
    <li>7 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “I testify that my mission is where I came to know that my Heavenly Father and my Savior, Jesus Christ, know and love me.” </li>
    <li>8 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “The place to begin is to remember that we are each a beloved child of God and that He has inspired servants. Those servants of God have foreseen the times in which we live.”</li>
    <li>9  Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “In His Church and kingdom, there are many opportunities to serve and minister to others as the Savior did. He wants you to be part of His great work.”</li>
    <li>10  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “During the past eight years, one of my assignments in the Twelve Apostles was to review and read all the remarkable Joseph Smith papers and documents and the research that led to the publication of the Saints volumes.” </li>
    <li>Position Statement- Missionary work can be very important. We do not always have to serve a mission to perform missionary work. Personally, I came home from my mission early, and was only able to spend 3 months in the field, but I feel no less like a missionary than anyone else. You can do missionary work by serving in the temple and by inviting others to join us in attending church.</li>
