    <li>1 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “I am grateful for [my family’s] enthusiastic support of this decision and for good friends who helped me decide to serve..”</li>
    <li>2 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “Looking back, I can see even more clearly that they trusted me and loved me. They taught me the gospel. They expected a lot from me..”</li>
    <li>3 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “Fathers and mothers of these wonderful youth, you have a vital role in this preparation process. Begin today to talk with your children about missionary service."</li>
    <li>4 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “And please consider this: whether or not we know them, we are each born of a mother and father. And each mother and father is born of a mother and father.5 By birth or adoptive lineage, we are ultimately all connected in the family of God and in the human family.” </li>
    <li>5 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “Whether you are your first or tenth known generation, connect yesterday for tomorrow. Connect the roots and branches in your living family tree.”</li>
    <li>6 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “When asked where meaning comes in life, most people rank family first. This includes family living and gone before. Of course, when we die, we don’t cease to exist. We continue to live on the other side of the veil.”</li>
    <li>7 Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, “Sometimes unwavering commitment to abiding family relationships helps us accomplish hard things. In some cases, community becomes family.”</li>

    <li>Position Statement- I believe that family is one of the most important things that we have on this earth. Family are here to love and appreciate us and to show us right from wrong. If we are able to keep focused and learn, we can spread the spirit to our families and also feel the spirit from them. Loving all those around us is important and loving our family is one of the most important and key things here on our life on earth.</li>

    <li>1 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “For you young and able sisters, a mission is also a powerful, but optional, opportunity. We love sister missionaries and welcome them wholeheartedly. What.”</li>
    <li>2 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “In those days, going on a mission was in the back of my mind, but it wasn’t something I talked about with my parents.”</li>
    <li>3 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “Although we did not attend church services as a family, that did not prevent me from attending occasionally with my friends..”</li>
    <li>4 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “To the missionaries currently serving, we thank you. Your mission has been during a worldwide pandemic. As a result, your mission experience has been unlike my mission experience or the experiences of any missionaries who served before 2020. I know it has not been easy. But even during these difficult times, the Lord has had a work for you to do, and you have done it wonderfully well.”</li>
    <li>5 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “He made clear that we are free to choose between right and wrong and that we cannot avoid the consequences of our choices.” </li>
    <li>6 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “If you look back on your life, I believe you will see that you have exercised faith many times. Joining the Church is an act of faith.”</li>
    <li>7 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, The Lord also operates through conditions: conditions of faith, conditions of righteousness, conditions of repentance.” </li>
    <li>8 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “Even God’s love, although infinite and perfect, is also subject to conditions.” </li>
    <li>9 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “First, we must humble ourselves. The Lord’s condition for change is humility. ‘If they humble themselves before me,’ He said. The opposite of humility is pride. Pride exists when we think we know better—when what we think or feel takes priority over what God thinks or feels.”</li>
    <li>10 Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “I realized that every decision I would make for the rest of my life would be influenced by these truths.”</li>
    <li>Position Statement- I feel like in terms of where my position is on Agency, I love that we are here to learn about agency. If we ponder our pre-mortal life, then we can realize that in that time, we learned what right and wrong are, but learning and experiencing are very different. We must experience right and wrong to be able to fully understand it. Wemust be here and make choices on our own to be able to return to Heavenly father as fully spiritual beings.</li>

<h1 name="Atonement" class="Atonement">Atonement</h1>
<ul name="AtonementList">
    <li>1 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “I love the Lord Jesus Christ and testify that His gospel is the only enduring solution for peace. His gospel is a gospel of peace.”</li>
    <li>2 Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “The spiritual darkness in the world makes the light of Jesus Christ needed more than ever.” </li>
    <li>3 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “President Kimball explained his vision for how the gospel would be taken to all the world. He called for many more missionaries from around the world.” </li>
    <li>4 M Russell Ballard- April 2022 General Conference, Missionary Service Blessed my Life Forever, “He reminded us of the Lord’s expectation “that every man should … lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the earth.” </li>
    <li>5 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “Anyone with eyes to see the signs of the times and ears to hear the words of prophets knows that is true. The perils of greatest danger come to us from the forces of wickedness. Those forces are increasing. And so it will become more difficult, not easier, to honor the covenants we must make and keep to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.” </li>
    <li>6 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “All of us face boisterous winds that can shake our faith and cause us to sink. When this happens, please remember that Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness has another name—the plan of redemption.” </li>
    <li>7 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “Heavenly Father knew that we would need to be redeemed. This is why He prepared the plan of redemption.”</li>
    <li>8 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “Coming unto Christ means more than just thinking about Him or talking about Him or even loving Him. It means following Him. It means living the way He teaches us to live.”</li>
    <li>9 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “I testify that the plan of happiness works. It was created by your Heavenly Father, who loves you. It works because Jesus Christ overcame sin and death through His Atonement.”</li>
    <li>10  Gerrit WW. Gong- April 2022 General Conference, We Each Have a Story, The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven.”</li>
    <li>Position Statement- The atonement is very important in the current age because we need to remember WHY it happened. If we are unable to remember why the atonement happened, then we will not be able to fully appreciate it. Jesus died so that we, as imperfect beings, could be forgiven and return to heavenly father once again. He loved us so much that he sacrificed a perfect body so that we could be perfect again like he was.</li>

<ul name="ForgivenessList">
    <li>1  Russel M Nelson- April 2022 General Conference, Preaching the Gospel of Peace, “As followers of Jesus Christ, we plead with leaders of nations to find peaceful resolutions to their differences.” </li>
    <li>2 Henry B. Eyring- April 2022 General Conference, Steady in the Storms, “Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.”</li>
    <li>3 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, “No matter where we are and where we have been, repentance is the way forward.”     </li>
    <li>4 Adrian Ochoa- April 2022 General Conference, Is the Plan Working?, ““Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance.” </li>
    <li>5 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “Third, through His grace He can make weak things become strong. If we humble ourselves and have faith in Jesus Christ, then His grace will enable us to change. In other words, He will empower us to change.” </li>
    <li>6 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “One of Satan’s greatest lies is that men and women cannot change. This untruth gets told and retold in many different ways as the world says that we simply cannot change” </li>
    <li>7 Kevin S Hamilton- April 2022 General Conference, Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong, “If our goal is to be authentic to this divine nature and destiny, then we will all need to change. The scriptural word for change is repentance.” </li>
    <li>8  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “In our day, many have adopted the concept that there should be no consequence for sin. They support the unconditional condoning of sin without repentance.”</li>
    <li>9  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “personal repentance is a commanded prerequisite to partake of the Savior’s Atonement and inherit the celestial kingdom.”</li>
    <li>10  Quentin L Cook- April 2022 General Conference, Conversion to the Will of God, “We understand the overwhelming significance of the Savior’s Atonement and of His saving ordinances and covenants, including those performed in the temple.” </li>
    <li>Position Statement- My position on Forgiveness is that it is incredibly important. I believe that if we are able to forgive others, then we will be blessed, because much like when we ask for forgiveness from heavenly father, we are able to be fully forgiven, and he will no longer remember our transgressions. Forgiveness is something that we can use to bring anyone to the gospel.</li>
